You will implement network Battleship (based on the original Battleship game).  The basic gameplay requirements you need are:

<ul>
<li>
The board must be at least 10x10
</li>
<li>
There must be at least 3 ships that are at least 3 tiles in size (they 
may be placed randomly).  At no time should a player see where another 
player's ships are located (they should still be able to see if 
something was hit on a particular square, however)
</li>
<li>
Must detect and indictate where I've tried shooting and whether or not 
it was a hit ('x' for hit and 'o' for miss is fine but do whatever as 
long as it's clear)
</li>
<li>
Players take turns- one player indicates a square (i.e. A1 or D4 or 
whatever square) and a shot is fired there.  Both players should see if 
that shot was a hit or a miss.
</li>
<li>
Win condition: Game must end and results must be shown when one player no longer has any ships remaining on the board
</li>
<li>
Your game must be better than the most recent Battleship game that was 
released by Activision (this is probably the easiest requirement on 
here)
</li>
</ul>

Specific requirements are as follows:
<ol>
<li>You will implement a client and server program. These will be 
separate but you may (and probably should) re-use code from both 
programs. You will utilize the SAME CONFIG FILE as in assignment 1.
</li><li>
When the client is started, prompt the user for a user name to use to 
identify the client. DO NOT PROMPT THE USER FOR THE IP/PORT OF THE 
SERVER, USE THE SAME CONFIG FILE AS IN ASSIGNMENT #1. You may choose 
whether or not you want to restrict the user name's length and if you 
wish to allow duplicate user names. Your choices should be reasonable 
i.e. don't restrict the name length to 2 characters, but 10 characters 
is probably fine.
</li><li>
Clients should then connect to the server. If a client cannot connect to
 the server, an error message should be displayed informing the user of 
what went wrong. The user should then be able to either try again or 
quit the program.
</li><li>
When connected, a client should be able to type "list users" or 
something similar, and a list of every user currently connected should 
be displayed. This list should show the user's username and their 
status. Status is determined by if a user is currently playing a game or
 not and should look like this:
<br>
1. user1 (available)
<br>
2. user2 (in game)
<br>
3. user3 (in game)
<br>
4. user4 (available)
<br>
</li><li>
A user can play a game of Battleship with another player. I should be 
able to type something like this:

play user1

and this will initiate a Battleship game with user1. If user1 is already
 in another game, an error message should be displayed that the user is 
not available. NOTE: you are NOT making a direct connection between the 
clients for playing a game; all packets should always go to the server 
and then it's the server's responsibility to forward them to the correct
 player. The server should be able to support multiple independent games
 of Battleship at the same time.
</li><li>
A Battleship game is played between users. The first player should be 
prompted for a move, and then when they type it, the second player 
should be prompted for a move. This continues until one player types 
"QUIT" or one player is the winnder, at which time the game ends. If a 
user types a move when it is not their turn, it should be ignored and an
 error message should be displayed (something like "it's not your turn" 
is fine).  If a user quites or is disconnected for any reason, the 
remaining player wins automatically.
</li><li>
When a game ends, the user should remain connected to the server in the 
same state that they were before the game started. This means that I 
could type "list users" again and see all the users on the server and 
potentially play another game against a different user.
</li><li>
A user can disconnect from the server by typing "Exit" or something like that.
</li><li>
Server should be able to tell if a user disconnects for any reason (if 
they type EXIT or are just booted off the network for some other 
reason). If that user is in a game, then the user they are playing (who 
is still connected) should be informat that their opponent has left the 
game and then should behave as though the user had typed QUIT to end the
 game (i.e. the remaining player is declared the winner)
</li>
</ol>


Extra credit:
<ol>
<li>
(5 points) "Spectator mode" - another user can watch a game between two 
players. They should be able to see the board status and the board 
should be re-displayed to that user. A spectator cannot make moves and 
is invisible to the players (yes, this facilitates collusion but that's 
ok for this assignment). A spectator may leave the game at any time, or 
may also re-join a game.
</li><li>
(2 points) as above, but a spectator can watch more than one game at the
 same time. Each board should display not only the moves, but the names 
of both opponents so that the user can readily identify which game that 
board belongs to.
</li><li>
(2 points) automated matchmaking- a client can log on to the server and 
type "start game" and the server will pick a random, non-busy opponent 
for them to play a game with.
</li><li>
(2 points) as above, but if no available player exists, the server will 
display something like "searching for players, please wait" and wait a 
reasonable amount of time for a player to become available and then 
match the two players at that time. If the time period expires and no 
players are available, an error message should be displayed.
</li>
<li>
(2 points) Players can choose where they want to place each of their ships
</li><li>
(3 points) All ships that ocurred in the original "Battleship" game are implemented, so destroyer, cruiser, battleship, carrier
</li>
</ol>

REMEMBER: if you attempt ANY extra credit, you must CLEARLY document in 
the README file which extra credit options you attempted so that I know 
to look for them. 
You should get the server's IP address and port from a config file that 
consists of two lines: the first line should be the IP address of the 
server, the second line should be the port that the server is listening 
on. A sample file might look like this:<hr>
<br>
10.12.66.84<br>
8000

<br>
<hr>
Both your client and server should take their settings from this file 
(the server only really needs to read the port since it knows its own IP
 address) and it should be called config.txt and should live in the same
 directory as your executable.
