	//if we wanted to talk to an infrared port, we'd use AF_IRDA
	//bluetooth is AF_BTM

	//SOCK_STREAM - tells us the type of socket.  SOCK_STREAM is two-way, reliable, connection-based byte streams
	//that can transmit OOB data.  uses TCP.  for UDP use SOCK_DGRAM, and for raw, use SOCK_RAW.  there are others also

	//IPPROTO_TCP- tells us to use the TCP protocol.  this parameter can only be used certain ways with
	//certain address family and type settings.  if we wanted UDP, we would have had to set our type to SOCK_DGRAM 
	//or we'll get an error.  passing 0 means that we dont' care about the protocol and the socket can choose

	//we enumerate all the protocols supported on this machine, we could pick one of them and pass it in here to get
	//an explicit protocol implementation.  mostly, we don't care, but if we were using IPX (for example) then we would
	//care a lot

	//0-  this is reserved, always set it to 0.  I'll ask Anthony wtf it's for

	//0-  these are the options.  normally the only one you'd care about is creating an overlapped socket for
	//use with IO ports.  if you want to do that, send WSA_IO_OVERLAPPED here.  more on that in a future demo
