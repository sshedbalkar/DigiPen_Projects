Scene.cpp:
1. Implements and stores the Shadow Transformation in the texture matrix GL_TEXTURE

shader1.vert:
1. Calculates the depth of light's penetration for each vertex

shader1.frag:
1. Interpolates the depth of light's penetration value into the scene to each pixel and writes it into the shadow map

shader2.vert:
1. Reads the Shadow Transformation from the texture matrix gl_TextureMatrix[0]
2. Calculates the Shadow Coordinate at each vertex using the shadow transformation
3. Calculates Phong lighting parameters

shader2.frag:
1. Calulates the coordinate used to lookup the light's depth from the shadow map
2. Calculates pixel depth
3. Compares Light depth and Pixel depth to see if the pixel lies within the shadow region or not
4. If the pixel is in shadow then returns the ambient light value if not then does the Phong lighting calculation on that pixel

To Remove Shadow Acne:
1. A small quantity (0.0001) is added to Light depth value during comparison to account for the floating point comaprison errors and to account for the shadow acne
