Features Implemented:
(20%) Draw one step of A* each frame (use toggle)
(15%) A path is always found if it exists (completeness)
(15%) The path is optimal with a heuristic weight of 1.0
(15%) The path is optimal with a heuristic weight of 0.0, and the search grows in a circular pattern
(5%) The path uses diagonals and doesn't run into corners
(5%) Calculate heuristic using both Euclidean, Octile, Chebyshev, and Manhattan methods (use toggle)
(5%) Straightline optimization (use toggle)
(10%) Rubberband final path where possible (use toggle)
(10%) Smooth using a Catmull-Rom spline (use toggle)
