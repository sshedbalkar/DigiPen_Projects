Compiling The Dev-C++ Project
------------------------------


Everything is included, so set-up should be very simple. Please note, however, that you will need to re-link libws2_32.a to the project if you put it in any directory other than C:\Dev-Cpp. Otherwise you'll get a compiler error when it doesn't find the library.


Compiling with Other Compilers
-------------------------------


You'll need to link libws2_32.a to the project, and add the following files:

1. Chat1.cpp
2. Chat1.h
3. Chat1.rc

The Chat1_private.h and Chat1_private.rc are for Dev-C++ use only.

Beyond that, I really can't help much, but it shouldn't be too much trouble to get everything working; as it's a relatively simple program :).
