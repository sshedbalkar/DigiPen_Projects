render.cpp:
1. Initializes the KD Tree
2. Implements raycasting and checks if a given ray intersects with the KD Tree
3. If such an intersection happens, it outputs the color of the pixel to the screen

KDTree.h:
	Class KDNode:
	1. Implements a KDNode Class which is used as a node in the KD Tree
	2. Has a list of all the polygons in the node
	3. Has a AABB covering all the polygons
	4. Has pointers to left and right side KD Nodes

	Class KDTree:
	1. Builds KD Tree from a given set of polygons
	2. implements function to check if a ray intersects with the KD Tree
	

Note:
Currently only the Raycasting part is working(Filled screen)
I have implemented the KD Tree but the it has bugs which I am not able to debug.
