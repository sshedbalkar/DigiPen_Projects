The functions and data structures involved in the Texture Map project are:

Data Structures:
1. Shade		Data Structure to store the texture coordinates and lighting info (if any) of a pixel
2. TransVertex	Data structure to store the 4D position value and the color info of a vertex. This is the parameter that will be passed from the Render() to Cliiper() to ScanlineCenvert()
3. Mipmap		Data structure to store the processed MIP map data and its meta data

Functions:
1. Clipper() and ScanConvert() have been changed so that now they accpet color info of the vertices and process them as well
2. SetPixel() has been changed so that now it can use a MIP map object
3. createMipmap()	Function which creates MIP map object from a Texture object
4. getMipRef()		Function used to get a pointer to the color sequence within a MIP map using the level and the coordinates within the MIP map
