render.cpp:
1. Initializes the KD Tree
2. Implements raycasting and checks if a given ray intersects with the KD Tree
3. If such an intersection happens, it outputs the color of the pixel to the screen

Struct KDNode:
1. Implements a KDNode Struct which is used as a node in the KD Tree
2. Has a list of all the polygons in the node
4. Has pointers to left and right side KD Nodes

I simplified my original KDTree implementation.
