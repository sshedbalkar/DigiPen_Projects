		- my implementation of part2, you may figure out some of my "design decision" for part 2. 
		Nothing fancy though. Run with a single argument: 
	<ul>
	<li> <tt>part2.anyfield.exe field4_part2</tt> - solvable with no guessing
	<li> <tt>part2.anyfield.exe field2_part2</tt> - solvable with no guessing
	<li> <tt>part2.anyfield.exe field6_part2</tt> - some guessing has to occure, my average is 7-8 busts (wrong guesses). 
			I implemented very simple probabilistic algorithm for guessing, if guessing "around" a square, choose square that has smallest probability
			of having a mine in adjacent unknown locations. Notice that in the beginning when there is no information at all, guessing should be done 
			absolutely randomely.
	<li> <tt>part2.anyfield.exe field_part2</tt> - some guessing has to occure, my average is 1-3 busts (wrong guesses).
