For this assignment you have to implement A* search algorithm.

<a href=".">files</a>

<a href="project.zip">zipped files</a>

<p>
See the provided code. 
Notes: 
<ul>
<li>you are only modifying "astar.cpp" and "astar.h". Graph implementation is
fixed. 
<li>Graph implementation <a href="graph.h">graph.h</a> uses templates to allow user-defined vertices and edges. 
<li>If you need more functionality from Graph class - email me and
I'll consider your request, do not modify Graph yourself!
<li>notice that Graph class uses directed edges, so each bidirectional edge should be inserted twice (1-&gt;2 and 2-&gt;1).
<li>Your Astar class should implement all methods currently called by the driver. You may define new methods of Astar class, or other classes.
<li>You'll probably end up defining Manhattan and Euclidean heuristics for testing purposes - do so in the driver, and NOT in any of the files that you submit.
