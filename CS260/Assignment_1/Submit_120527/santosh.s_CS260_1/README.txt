1. config.txt is NOT placed at where the executables are but at the root location(i.e. where the VS solution file is located). Because I don't want to place 2 seperate config.txt files for debug and release.
2. When the client starts, it immediately reads the config.txt file and tries to connect to the server.
3. Type "/q" to quit the session.
4. This project meets the bare minimum requirement of the assignment, no additional things are implemented
